# vherus/ZenCash-Payment-Gateway

Payment gateway package for ZenCash integrations.

### Easy Mode Pre-requisites

- [docker-ce](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

### Easy Mode

Once you've completed the pre-requisite steps above, run `bin/setup` from the project root directory.

The setup script creates a Composer docker container to install project dependencies, removes the container, builds & runs a php-cli container and executes the test suite.

You're welcome to install `PHP >= 7.2` and `PHPUnit` on your local machine instead if you want to go hardcore.
